Elevate Your Learning: AI-Powered Test Generator for Text

### [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/exaimination), [Frontend sample](https://exaimination.vercel.app/)

## Project Description

We recognized the challenge of revising covered chapters and devised a solution utilizing AI. Our project leverages OpenAI's API, fine-tuned to read chapter/document data and generate questions. Users can upload .txt files or input text directly, generating a set of questions tailored to their input. Upon answering, the system evaluates responses, providing a score to users.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data:**
   - Users upload .txt files or input text directly.
   - The AI processes the data and generates a set of questions.

2. **Question Evaluation:**
   - Users answer generated questions.
   - Backend evaluates responses, considering similarity scores for descriptive questions.

3. **Immediate Feedback:**
   - Users receive immediate feedback and a score reflecting their understanding.

4. **PDF Integration (Future Enhancement):**
   - Utilizing "pdfjs-dist" module, the system can read PDFs.
   - Frontend sends PDF to Backend for processing and evaluation using the fine-tuned model.
   - Users can download questions and answer keys.

## Challenges Faced

- **Integration of Technologies:**
  - Seamless integration of Python-based AI model with Node.js backend and Next.js frontend required careful consideration of data formats and communication protocols.

- **Ensuring Question Quality:**
  - Maintaining clear, unbiased, and grammatically correct questions demanded continuous evaluation and improvement of the AI model's outputs.

## Achievements

- **Innovative Technology Use:**
  - Utilized Next.js, Node.js, and Python for a seamless user experience and efficient data handling.

- **Automated Test Generation:**
  - Automated test creation based on parameters and learning objectives, saving time for educators and ensuring consistent, quality tests.

- **Educational Contribution:**
  - Contributed to educational technology by providing educators with innovative tools for student learning and assessment.

- **Immediate Feedback and Resources:**
  - Offered immediate feedback to users and downloadable questions and answers for further study.

## Lessons Learned

- **AI Integration and Fine-tuning:**
  - Practical application of AI in web applications and model fine-tuning using Python.

- **Full-Stack Development:**
  - Hands-on experience with Next.js, Node.js, and Python for full-stack development.

- **Effective Collaboration:**
  - Developed collaboration and teamwork skills, enhancing communication and problem-solving abilities.

- **Continuous Learning:**
  - Embraced continuous learning, refining skills, seeking feedback, and incorporating new knowledge for project improvement.

## Future Enhancements

- **PDF Reading:**
  - Implementing PDF reading using "pdfjs-dist" for expanded data input options.
  - Enabling PDF processing and evaluation through the fine-tuned model.

- **Downloadable Questions:**
  - Enhancing the download feature to include questions and answer keys for teaching purposes.
